    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "After this notebook you should be able to...\n",
    "+ Be familiar with the vocabulary used in scikit-learn's documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "+ [Official scikit-learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)\n",
    "+ [Official scikit-learn tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)\n",

    "+ [Podcast with Andreas Mueller](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/09/27/scikit-learn-with-andreas-mueller/) - simple and for beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook covers the basics of the excellent and popular Python machine learning library **scikit-learn**. It is pronounced sy-kit-learn. Think of a science kit for learning. The primary purpose of scikit-learn is to make machine learning easy to run. It only takes a few lines of code to train a model and predict with it. The interface to working with scikit-learn is simple and standardized for all models. Let's first take a look at some of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary\n",
    "* **samples** - Number of observations in the dataset. Also known as rows, **`n`**\n",
    "* **features** - All the variables in the dataset. Also known as columns, predictors, **`X`**\n",
    "* **estimator** - Word used for each machine learning model. An estimator is any object that learns from data; it may be a classification, regression or clustering algorithm or a transformer that extracts/filters useful features from raw data. \n",
    "* **supervised learning** - Data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict\n",
    "* **classification** - Samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data.\n",
    "* **regression** - The desired output consists of one or more continuous variables\n",
    "* **labels** - In supervised classification, the result or **target** variable for each row. The variable we are trying to predict, **`y`**\n",
    "* **unsupervised learning** - The training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation. \n",
    "* **estimator parameters** - All estimators are instantiated from their estimator classes with a set of parameters. These parameters uniquely tune your model. For example, in a random forest you can set the number of decision trees, tree depth and several others.\n",
    "* **fitting the data** - All estimators have a **fit** method that train the model.\n",
    "* **predicting** - Many estimators have a **predict** method that will return a predicted value for each sample.\n",
    "* **transform** - Some estimators have a **transform** method that will transform your data into. For example, when doing principle component analysis, there is no prediction only transformation of your data from one feature space to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-learn dependencies\n",
    "Since many of you will be coming from a background using pandas to do your data analysis you might be surprised to find that scikit-learn is not dependent at all on pandas. You must have the numpy and scipy libraries installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas vs Scikit-learn\n",
    "pandas and scikit-learn are two related but different libraries. pandas is likely where the vast majority of your workflow will reside when you are performing a data analysis. Once you have thoroughly explored and investigated your data and have prepared it for machine learning you then turn to scikit-learn to train and test your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope of Scikit-learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn does not contain all the machine learning algorithms in the world, not even close. It contains the most popular and powerful methods that you will find in introductory machine learning texts. In addition to the common machine learning models, it provides lots of other tools for preprocessing data, transforming text data, model validation and scoring, tuning parameters and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What other Python machine learning libraries are used?\n",
    "Scikit-learn covers the vast majority of use cases. Here are some areas where other libraries work better\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **deep learning** - [keras](https://keras.io/), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)\n",
    "+ **big data** - Spark with [pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html)\n",
    "+ **regresion output** - scikit-learn does not produce regression output containing t-statistics, p-values, etc... You will need to uses [statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)\n",
    "+ **association rules** - [orange3](https://orange3-associate.readthedocs.io)\n",
    "+ **recommender systems** - build your own.\n",
    "+ **natural language processing** - [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/), [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also lots of [other scikits](http://scikits.appspot.com/scikits) out there for different scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy arrays\n",
    "Scikit-learn uses numpy's n-dimensional array (ndarray) to pass data around and occasionally scipy's sparse matrices. It is possible to pass in pandas DataFrames and Series to scikit-learn methods. But, scikit-learn will immediately turn them into ndarrays. I always convert my data into a numpy array before I use any scikit-learn functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Missing Values\n",
    "Scikit-learn does not handle missing values natively. You will need to remove all missing values from your dataset before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-learn package\n",
    "The scikit-learn package is built of many sub-packages that each cover a different part of machine learning. You will almost always interact with scikit-learn by importing a specific class or function in the following manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "> `from sklearn.sub_package import SomeEstimator`\n",
    "\n",
    "Or like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `from sklearn.sub_package import some_function`\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to [look through the API right now](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) to see all the available functionality scikit-learn has to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best of API\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of sub-packages and a tremendous amount of classes and functions available for you to import into your project. The below classes and functions are, from my experience, the most commonly used ones. Make sure to explore the API in-depth to become aware of all things you can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets\n",
    "Scikit-learn has many datasets that come packaged with it for quick exploration. \n",
    "+ **`sklearn.datasets`** - `load_digits, load_boston, load_iris`\n",

    "#### Dummy Estimators\n",
    "Use this as the default model for starting out.\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.dummy`** - `DummyClassifier, DummyRegressor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing\n",
    "These use the **`transform`** or **`fit_transform`** methods\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.preprocessing`** - `StandardScaler, PolynomialFeatures`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neighbors\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.neighbors`** - `KNeighborsClassifier, KNeighborsRegressor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discriminant analysis\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.discriminant_analysis`** - `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NaiveBayes\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.naive_bayes`** - `MultinomialNB`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Models\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.linear_model`** - `LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.tree`** - `DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support vector machines\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.svm`** - `SVR, SVC`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neural Networks\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.neural_network`** - `MLPClassifier, MLPRegressor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble\n",
    "Mainly tree-based ensembling.\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.ensemble`** - `RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingClassifier, GradientBoostingRegressor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.cluster`** - `KMeans`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix decomposition\n",
    "These use the **`transform`** or **`fit_transform`** methods.\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.decomposition`** - `PCA, NMF, LatentDirichletAllocation`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Extraction\n",
    "These use the **`transform`** or **`fit_transform`** methods.\n",
    "+ **`feature_extraction.text`** - `CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pipeline\n",
    "+ **`sklearn.pipeline`** - `Pipeline`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regressor vs Classifier\n",
    "Notice that most of the supervised machine learning methods have one class each for regression and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sklearn gotchas\n",
    "+ By convention put your input array into a variable named **`X`** and target array into variable **`y`**.\n",
    "+ Convert both input and output to numpy arrays before using scikit-learn\n",
    "+ Your input array must be two-dimensional, even if there is only one predictor variable\n",
    "+ Although, you can have multiple labels for your **`y`** for each observation, this is very rare. When you have a single label for each observation, convert your **`y`** into a one dimensional numpy array.\n",
    "+ **`X`** and **`y`** must not contain any missing values\n",
    "+ **`X`** must be all numeric.\n",
    "+ **`y`** can be an array of strings or numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical workflow from pandas to prediction\n",
    "Here is an outline of a very basic workflow for going from initial data pull to machine learning\n",
    "> `read data in pandas dataframe` \n",
    "> `lots of pandas manipulations`  \n",
    "> `Do lots of EDA`  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `Still in pandas, prepare for machine learning`  \n",
    "> `Remove missing values`  \n",
    "> `Binarize columns with string values with pd.get_dummies`  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `move to sklearn by converting pandas objects to numpy arrays X and y`  \n",
    "> `Scale continuous features`  \n",
    "> `Other transformation to either features or target variables - take log, etc...`  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `Split data - kfold, or validation set`  \n",
    "> `Import estimator from sklearn`  \n",
    "> `Instantiate estimator`  \n",
    "> `Use fit method`  \n",
    "> `Use predict or score method to validate model`  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Scikit-learn on the Titanic dataset\n",
    "We will begin with the classic titanic dataset. We will try to predict the survival of each person. We will build a very simple model first and then add more features and use more complex models."
